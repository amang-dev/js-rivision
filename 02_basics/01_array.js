//! ******* Arrays *************


//? The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name



//! Shallow copy

// A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made.

//! Deep copy

// A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made



//? ***** Array Methods ********

const myarr = [1,2,3,4,5]

console.log(typeof myarr)


console.log(myarr.includes(2));
console.log(myarr.indexOf(2));


const newArr = myarr.join()
console.log(myarr);
console.log(newArr);


//? **** slice, splice ***


const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

const myn1 = arr.slice(1,3)

console.log(arr);
console.log( myn1);


const myn2= arr.splice(1,3)
console.log(arr);
console.log(myn2);






// splice modify the original array
// slice do not modifie the original array


let myarr1 =[1,2,3,5,4,8,9,7]

console.log(myarr1.slice(1, 3));
console.log(myarr1);

console.log(myarr1.splice(1,3));
console.log(myarr1);
